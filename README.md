Contains the EDA, training, evaluation, and data processing code for Koel Labs. Evaluation results will be made available via [Hugging Face Leaderboards](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KoelLabs/IPA-Transcription-EN). Cleaned datasets and model weights will also be made available via [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/KoelLabs).

Read about all our repositories [here](https://github.com/KoelLabs).

## Setup

Checkout the [guides](./guides) directory for standalone guides on finetuning, evaluation, dataset processing, and other topics. 
These can be run independently of the setup for the rest of the codebase, e.g., in a Colab notebook.

See the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for alternative setup instructions and details.

0. `git clone https://github.com/KoelLabs/ML.git`
1. Install Python 3.10.16
2. Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Fill in the necessary environment variables.
3. Run the commands in './scripts/install.sh', e.g., with `. ./scripts/install.sh`.
